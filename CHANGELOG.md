# CHANGELOG

## 0.1.2 (2017-02-19)

* Fixed a minor bug re: interaction between using `play!` with an `event-set` and adjusting start/end bounds via the `from` and `to` options.

## 0.1.1 (2017-02-09)

* Added a `play-with-opts!` function that is like `play!`, but allows the caller to override the playback options used when playing the score.
